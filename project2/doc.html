            <p style="font-size: 13px;">I believe I hit all of the required parts of the rubric for project 2: <br><br>
                - Using the Pokédex API, you are able to
                access information about any pokemon. You can also sort by types and limit the number of results<br>
                - Local storage keeps track of your last used search term and displays it after updated<br>
                - There are three controls. The search field, the type sort, and the result limiter<br>
                - Code was validated and there are no JavaScript, HTML, or CSS errors<br>
                - I think the code has been organized well and the javascript has been thouroughly commented on. (No use
                of var and getElementById)<br>
                - Bad responses are returned to the user<br>
                - Although not modified to handle small devices the page works at any size without problems
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>All things considered, I think this project deserves a 95 or higher</p>
