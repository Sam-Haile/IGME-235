    <h1>Goal</h1>
    <p>My main goal is to create a portfolio that highlights my best work. I hope to retain potential employers
        attention by creating a well functioning website. I think this layout can provide me with a good amount of space
        to talk about the process of making a project</p>
    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <p>It's evident I didn't plan out my time as well as I could have. As a result there are some parts of the first
        phase that I had to cut corners on. The bottom section of the source PDF I had to replicate was especially
        frusterating at times.</p>
